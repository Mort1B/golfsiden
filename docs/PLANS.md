# Plans

`PLANS.md` owns unresolved work and bounded next steps. Current behavior belongs
in `Documentation.md`; durable boundaries belong in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Active step

None. The bounded reliability/usability step is complete.

Every implementation step updates affected durable docs and LatestExplanation,
removes its completed plan item, commits only its scope and stops before the
next. No budgets, transfer penalties, newly generated picks, sporting team
generation, public Fantasy sharing, prizes/payments or offline queued selection
writes are in this plan.

## Later queue

- Optional offline preparation for browser closure/eviction: requires a separately
  scoped app-shell and private scorecard-retention/reauthorization design before
  implementation. Current in-memory return and durable queued edits remain distinct.

- Deferred broader security assessment: further production proxy/database privilege,
  recovery and dependency-advisory investigation. Revisit for a specific finding
  or a separately requested assessment, rather than making another broad review
  a prerequisite for continued functional testing.

### Remaining deployment acceptance

The remaining PERSIST-1 same-account/actual-login scenarios may be revisited if
testing feedback warrants them; see the original
[validation limits](validation/match-note-retention-2026-09-23/README.md). Local
PostgreSQL validation is now available through rootless Podman. The functional
checks cover real database-backed match recovery after locking, but do not claim
every separate session-replacement scenario.

Public-host acceptance still needs a Docker Engine environment and public DNS/TLS
validation. Native 200% browser zoom and physical Android Chrome remain unverified.
Hosting and deployment checks belong to the user. These historical acceptance
limits do not expand the application-readiness step into server administration
or another assessment. Broader device coverage and polish can follow feedback.

No automatic opponents/byes/brackets, new sporting scoring rules, team match play,
extra holes, public match sharing, cold offline launch or background sync is included.
Fantasy remains separate from sporting scores and completion rules.
